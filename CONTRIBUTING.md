# Contribute to best-of-generator

Thanks for your interest in contributing to our project. This page will give you a quick overview of how things are organized and, most importantly, how to get involved.

Everyone is welcome to contribute, and we value everybody's contribution. Code is thus not the only way to help the community. Answering questions, helping others, reaching out and improving the documentations are immensely valuable to the projects as well.

## Issues and bug reports

- We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancement requests. Submit issues for any [feature request and enhancement](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of-generator/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=02_feature-request.md&title=), [bugs](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of-generator/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=01_bug-report.md&title=), or [documentation](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of-generator/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation&template=03_documentation.md&title=) problems.
- First, do a quick search on the Github issue tracker or the known issues section in the readme to see if the issue has already been reported. If so, it's often better to just leave a comment on an existing issue rather than creating a new one. Old - and sometimes closed - issues also often include helpful tips and solutions to common problems.
- When creating an issue, try using one of our [issue templates](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of-generator/issues/new/choose) which already contain some guidelines on which content is expected to process the issue most efficiently. If no template applies, you can of course also create an issue from scratch.
- Please provide as much context as possible when you open an issue. The information you provide must be comprehensive enough to reproduce that issue for the assignee. Therefore, contributors should use but aren't restricted to the issue template provided by the project maintainers.
- Please apply one or more applicable [labels](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of-generator/labels) to your issue so that all community members are able to cluster the issues better.
- If you have questions about one of the existing issues, please comment on them, and one of the maintainers will clarify.

## Contributing to the code base

You are welcome to contribute code in order to fix a bug, to implement a new feature, to propose new documentation, or just to fix a typo. Check out [good first issue](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of-generator/labels/good%20first%20issue) and [help wanted](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of-generator/labels/help%20wanted) issues if you want to find open issues to implement.

- Before writing code, we strongly advise you to search through the existing PRs or issues to make sure that nobody is already working on the same thing. If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your reaction (👍 - upvote, 👎 - downvote). If you are unsure, it is always a good idea to open an issue to get some feedback.
- Should you wish to work on an existing issue that has not yet been claimed, please claim it first by commenting on the GitHub issue that you want to work on and begin work (the maintainers will assign it to your GitHub user as soon as they can). This is to prevent duplicated efforts from other contributors on the same issue.
- To contribute changes, always branch from the `main` branch and after implementing the changes create a pull request as described [below](#opening-a-pull-request).
- Commits should be as small as possible while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests). Also, make sure to follow the commit message guidelines.
- Test your changes as thoroughly as possible before you commit them. Preferably, automate your test by unit/integration tests.

### Development Instructions

To simplify the process of building this project from scratch, we provide build-scripts - based on [universal-build](https://github.com/ml-tooling/universal-build) - that run all necessary steps (build, test, and release) within a containerized environment by using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to run all actions locally.

> _Please refer to the [documentation of universal-build](https://github.com/ml-tooling/universal-build#automated-build-pipeline-ci) for instructions on how to execute the build-scripts directly on your machine instead of using the containerized approach documented below. This local execution would not require Docker._

#### Requirements

- [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act#installation), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

#### Build components

Execute this command in the project root folder to compile, assemble, and package all project components:

```bash
act -b -s BUILD_ARGS="--make" -j build
```

You can also run the build only for a specific (sub-)component by providing the path to the component folder, as shown below:

```bash
act -b -s BUILD_ARGS="--make" -s WORKING_DIRECTORY="./docs" -j build
```

#### Run linting & style checks

To run all relevant linting and code style checks for all components, execute:

```bash
act -b -s BUILD_ARGS="--check" -j build
```

#### Run integration & unit tests

Once all the project artifacts are build, you can execute this command in the project root folder to run the integration & unit tests for all components:

```bash
act -b -s BUILD_ARGS="--test" -j build
```

It is also possible to combine multiple steps into one command:

```bash
act -b -s BUILD_ARGS="--check --make --test" -j build
```

The `--check --make --test` steps are configured as default. If you call the job without `BUILD_ARGS` the build and test steps will be executed:

```bash
act -b -j build
```

#### Release a new version

To release a new version and publish all relevant artifacts to the respective registries (e.g. Docker image to DockerHub) you can either trigger our release pipeline locally via Act or from the Github UI. For a release, you have to provide a valid version based on [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) standard.

##### Via Act (locally)

To build all components and publish all artifacts from your local machine, execute:

```bash
act -b -s VERSION="<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>" -j release
```

In case you also want to automatically create a valid Github release, you also need to provide a valid `GITHUB_TOKEN` as a secret (`-s GITHUB_TOKEN=<token>`). Please refer to the next section for information on how to finish and publish the release.

##### Via Github Actions

To trigger our release pipeline from Github UI, you can either close a milestone that has a valid version name (`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) or execute the release pipeline manually via the `workflow_dispatch` UI in the Action Tab (`Actions -> release-pipeline -> Run Workflow`). The release pipeline will automatically create a pull request for the new version as well as a draft release on Github.

After successful execution of the release pipeline, the following steps are required to finish the release:

1. Merge the release PR into `main`. Preferably via merge commit to keep the version tag in the `main` branch. We suggest to use the following message for the merge commit: `Finalize release for version <VERSION> (#<PR>)`.
2. Adapt the changelog of the draft release on Github (in the release section). Mention all other changes that are not covered by pull requests.
3. Publish the release.

##### Resolve an unsuccessful release

In case the release pipeline fails at any step, we suggest to fix the problem based on the release pipeline logs and create a new release with an incremented `patch` version. To clean up the unsuccessful release, make sure to delete the following artifacts (if they exist): the release branch, the release PR, the version tag, the draft release, and any release artifact that was already published (e.g. on DockerHub, NPM or PyPi).

### Commit messages guidelines

Commit messages should be as standardized as possible within the repository. A few best practices:

1. Always use simple present (imperative mood) to describe what the commit does. Explain what & why, not how!
2. Start with a capital letter.
3. Don’t end the subject line with a period.
4. Descriptive but short subject line (< 50 chars).
5. Link to issues by mentioning them in commit messages.
6. Examples: `Add image to documentation section 3`, `Fix memory leak. Closes #3`, `Split method X into two methods`. Refer to [this blog](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for more information about good commit messages.

### Opening a pull request

1. **Set title**. The title should follow our [commit message guidelines](#commit-messages-guidelines) (example: `Fix memory leak in picture loader`). If the pull request closes a specific issue, the title can be used to mention the issue (example: `Fix memory leak in picture loader. Closes #3`). Prefix the title with `[WIP]` *(Work In Progress)* to indicate that you are not done but need clarification or an explicit review before you can continue your work item.
2. **Add appropriate labels** (e.g. bug, enhancement, documentation).
3. **Set description:** Describe what the pull request is about and add some bullet points describing what’s changed and why (make use of the provided template). Link the pull request to all relevant issues in the pull request description (e.g. `Closes #10`). Find more information on linking pull requests to issues [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue). Add `BREAKING CHANGE` into the description in case the PR introduces breaking changes.
4. Open the pull request and make sure existing tests and checks pass. The PR will only be merged into `main` if it is consistent with style and linting guidelines.
  
### Review & merging of a pull request

1. Every pull request will be reviewed by at least 1 reviewer and will also trigger CI pipelines to automatically build and test the changes. If your PR is not getting reviewed for a longer time, you can @-reply a reviewer in the pull request or comment.
2. Every comment on PR should be accepted as a change request and should be discussed. When something is optional, it should be noted in the comment. If a review requires you to make additional changes, please test the changes again. Create a comment on the PR to notify the reviewers that your amendments are ready for another round of review.
3. Once the pull request is approved by at least 1 reviewer, the pull request can be merged. `Squash & merge` is the preferred merging strategy.
4. In case a new (feature) branch was created in the main repository, please delete this branch after a successful merge.

### Git workflow & versioning

- We use [GitLab Flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/university/training/gitlab_flow.html#release-branch) as our branching workflow.
- Feature branching: Use (short-lived) feature branches. Naming schema:  `feature/<DESCRIPTION>`, if related to one specific issue use suffix: `feature/<DESCRIPTION>/<ISSUE-NUMBER>`. In addition to the `feature/` prefix, we recommend using more descriptive feature branch prefixes such as `bugfix/` for bug-fixes, `maintenance/` for maintenance or refactoring changes, and `documentation/` for changes related to the documentation.
- For versioning, we have adapted the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) standard. All version tags on Git must be prefixed with `v` (e.g.`v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>`). The version can be suffixed with a tag that indicates a pre-release or unfinished version. All our local development builds will use the following dev suffix: `-dev.<BRANCH>`.

## Code conventions

### Python conventions

- Code Style: [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Documentation Style: [Google Style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) (checked by [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle))
- Naming Conventions: [naming-convention-guides](https://github.com/naming-convention/naming-convention-guides/tree/master/python#python-naming-convention)
- Build Tool: [setuptool](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools)
- Code Formatter: [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
- Import Sorting: [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort)
- Linting: [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8)
- Type Checking: [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)
- Testing: [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/) + [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)
- Logging: [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)
- Package Manager: [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip)
- Use type hints wherever possible: [Cheatsheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet_py3.html)
- Minimum compatibility: Python 3.6

#### Code style & naming

- **Code style** should loosely follow [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
- **Documentation style** should follow the [Google style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).
- **Naming** should follow the recommendations [here](https://github.com/naming-convention/naming-convention-guides/tree/master/python#python-naming-convention).

#### Code formatting

We use [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) for code formatting and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) for import sorting. The following commands run `black` and `isort` on all Python files of the component (when executed in the component root):

```bash
isort --profile black src
black src
```

If you want to only check if the formatting and sorting is applied correctly to all files, execute:

```bash
# formatting check:
black --check src
# import sorting check:
isort --profile black --check-only src
```

You can also configure `black` and `isort` inside your code editor. For example, if you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python), you can add the following to your `settings.json` for formatting and auto-format your files on save:

```json
{
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "python.sortImports.args": [
        "--multi-line=3",
        "--trailing-comma",
        "--force-grid-wrap=0",
        "--use-parentheses",
        "--line-width=88"
    ],
    "[python]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-python.python",
        "editor.formatOnPaste": false,
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
            "source.organizeImports": true
        }
    }
}
```

#### Code linting

We use [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) for linting, [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) for type checking, and [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle) for docstring style checks. You can find our flake8 configuration inside the `setup.cfg` or [here](.github/linters/.flake8). The following commands run `flake8`, `mypy` and `pydocstyle` on all python files of the component (when executed in the component root):

```bash
# type checks
mypy src
# linting
flake8 src
# docstring checks
pydocstyle src
```

You can also configure `flake8`, `mypy`, and `pydocstyle` inside your code editor. For example, if you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python), you can add the following to your `settings.json` for linting and type checking:

```json
{
    "python.linting.enabled": true,
    "python.linting.lintOnSave": true,
    "python.linting.pylintEnabled": false,
    "python.linting.mypyEnabled": true,
    "python.linting.pydocstyleEnabled": true,
    "python.linting.pydocstyleArgs": ["--convention=google"],
    "python.linting.flake8Enabled": true,
    "python.linting.flake8Args": [
        "--ignore=E203,E501,W503"
    ]
}
```

#### Adding & running tests

We use the [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/) framework for testing. For more info on this, see the [pytest documentation](http://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html). Tests for modules and classes live in their own directories of the same name inside the `tests` folder. To be discovered, all test files and test functions need to be prefixed with `test_`. To run the test suite, execute:

```bash
# Run full test suite:
pytest
# Exclude all slow tests
pytest -m "not slow"
```

When adding tests, make sure to use descriptive names, keep the code short and concise and only test for one behavior at a time. Try to avoid unnecessary imports and use `parametrize` test cases wherever possible. Parametrizing tests allows to test multiple inputs to a function and verify that they return the expected output. Use [fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html) to share test setups with - optional - setup and tear-down routines. Fixtures can also be parameterized. Extensive tests that take a long time should be marked with `@pytest.mark.slow`.
